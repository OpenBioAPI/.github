# OpenBioAPI

Welcome to **OpenBioAPI** – an initiative dedicated to gathering, curating, and standardizing OpenAPI specifications for Bioinformatics Databases and Tools available on the internet.

## Mission

The mission is to provide a centralized, well-maintained collection of OpenAPI specifications for the bioinformatics ecosystem.

- **Simplify integration** with bioinformatics resources
- **Promote interoperability** across tools and databases
- **Accelerate development** of bioinformatics applications

## Goals

### Current Focus
- **Gather** OpenAPI specifications from existing bioinformatics APIs
- **Curate** and validate specifications for accuracy and completeness
- **Standardize** API definitions following OpenAPI best practices

### Future Roadmap
- **Auto-generate client libraries** in multiple programming languages from curated specifications
- **Provide proxy servers** for consistent API access
- **Develop mock servers** for testing and development workflows
- **Create memorizing proxy servers** for reproducible testing and offline development

## Benefits

By using OpenBioAPI resources, developers and researchers can:

- Access **consistent and standardized client interfaces** for bioinformatics APIs
- Leverage **auto-generated clients** to reduce boilerplate code
- Utilize **mock servers** for reliable testing without depending on live services
- Employ **memorizing proxies** for reproducible experiments and offline workflows

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to:

- Submit a new OpenAPI specification
- Improve existing specifications
- Report issues or suggest enhancements
- Help with documentation
