# OpenBioAPI

This initiative is dedicated to gathering, curating, and standardizing OpenAPI specifications for Bioinformatics Databases and Tools available on the internet.

**Currently all code under this Org is vibe-coded slop.**

However, Clojure client generation is already working rather nicely.

# Next Goals

- gather specs for the [Global Core Bioinformatics Resources](https://globalbiodata.org/what-we-do/global-core-biodata-resources/list-of-current-global-core-biodata-resources/)
- spec for Ensembl
- Python client generation
- fix/update Clojure client templates
- memoizing proxy server template
